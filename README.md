# My first Basic Calculator
- This is it! It is my final project in Odin Project's 
Foundations Course.
- I implement a basic calculator that can `add`, 
`subtract`, `mulitply` and `divide` numbers. 
- Two kinds of numbers will accommodated: `Float` 
and `Integer`.
- **Note**: This project doesn't cover complex
computations including but not limited to exponentiation, 
square roots, and trigonometric functions.
- This is an application to all the fundamentals of
HTML, CSS and Javascript, especially Forms, Flexbox, 
DOM Manipulation, Control Statements, Arrays, and Objects.
