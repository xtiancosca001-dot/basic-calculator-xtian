# My first Basic Calculator
- This is it! It is my final project in Odin Project's 
Foundations Course.
- I implement a basic calculator that can `add`, 
`subtract`, `mulitply` and `divide` numbers. 
- Two kinds of numbers will accommodated: `Float` 
and `Integer`.
- **Note**: This project doesn't cover complex
computations including but not limited to exponentiation, 
square roots, percentage, and trigonometric functions.
- This is an application to all the fundamentals of
HTML, CSS and Javascript, especially Forms, Flexbox, 
DOM Manipulation, Control Statements, Arrays, and Objects. 

## Keyboard Functions

|  Function  |  Key  |
|---|---|
| Numbers | `0...9` |
| Add | `+` |
| Subtract | `-` |
| Multiply | `*` |
| Divide | `/` |
| Integer (+/-) | `n` |
| Clear (C) | `c` |
| Decimal Point | `.` |
| Backspace | `backspace` |
| Equal | `=` or `enter` |
| Secret Message | `l` |

## Remarks
1. This calculator app supports both Click and Keyboard Support.
2. When the equal sign is pressed, the user cannot:
   - Add Decimals
   - Backspace
   - Negate the value
3. But, the user can perform a new operation after evaluation.
4. Repeating Operations are also supported if the user presses the = button
   several times. But the basis of accumulation is the last operand and the 
   last operator entered.
